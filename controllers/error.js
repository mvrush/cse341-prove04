    // To make the 404 page work I had to add 'path: 'Error'' so that a path was defined for the navigation include. The navigation include is looking for the 'path' value in my "class=" JavaScript. In this since there is no path you can just use ' path: '' ' or you can make a dummy name like ' path: 'Error' '. It just needs the 'path' object.
